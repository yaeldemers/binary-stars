# binary-stars

This was our final project on the Algol and Cappella binary star systems. The CCD Images folder is our data collected over two separate observations. The "Mock Calibration" file is what we used to average our calibration dark and bias frames. The "TESS Comparison Appendix Plot" is our first comparison to theoretical TESS data, and is the plot used in the Appendix. The "data-processing" notebook is where we did our data analysis for this project, and includes every other plot shown in the report.
